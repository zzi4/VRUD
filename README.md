# VRUD: A Drone Dataset for Complex Vehicle-VRU Interactions within Mixed Traffic

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-Open%20Source-blue)](https://github.com/zzi4/VRUD)

**Vehicle-Vulnerable Road User Interaction Dataset** — Collected from urban villages in Shenzhen, China.

## Overview

VRUD addresses the critical gap in open-source datasets for **chaotic, unstructured urban mixed-traffic** environments. Unlike datasets focused on highways or regulated intersections, VRUD captures the "long-tail" scenarios where VRUs constitute the majority of traffic participants and interactions are driven by negotiation rather than rigid rules.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Recording** | 4 hours @ 4K/30Hz |
| **VRU Trajectories** | 11,479 |
| **Vehicle Trajectories** | 1,939 |
| **Interaction Scenarios** | 4,002 |
| **VRU Proportion** | ~87% |

## Key Features

- **Extreme VRU density** — Pedestrians, motorcycles, tricycles, bicycles
- **OpenDRIVE HD maps** — Standard format for map-based research
- **VTTC-based scenario extraction** — 4,002 multi-agent interaction samples
- **7 categories** — Cars, buses, trucks, bicycles, motorcycles, tricycles, pedestrians
